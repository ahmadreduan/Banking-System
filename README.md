    char filename[150];
    snprintf(filename, sizeof(filename), "userdata/%s.txt", account_number);

    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("No account found with the account number: %s\n", account_number);
        return;
    }

    char line[256];
    double initial_deposit = 0;
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file) != NULL) {
        if (sscanf(line, "Initial Deposit: %lf", &initial_deposit) == 1) {
            printf("Current Balance: %.2lf\n", initial_deposit);
            break;
        }
    }
    fclose(file);
}
```
